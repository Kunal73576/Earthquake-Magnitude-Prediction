# 🌍 Earthquake Magnitude Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach

![Project Banner](sandbox:/mnt/data/comparison_actual_vs_predicted.png)

## 📌 Overview  
Earthquakes are unpredictable natural disasters that can cause devastating impacts. This project applies **machine learning models** to predict earthquake magnitudes using **historical seismic data** from multiple regions in New Zealand.

The goal is to develop a **reliable earthquake magnitude prediction model** using features like location, seismic activity, and temporal characteristics.

## 🚀 Features  
✔ Data preprocessing and feature engineering.  
✔ Implementation of **Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Regression** models.  
✔ Performance evaluation using **Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score**.  
✔ Regional and magnitude-based performance analysis.  
✔ Model interpretability using feature importance analysis and LIME explanations.  

## 📁 Dataset  
The dataset consists of earthquake records collected from **10 regions in New Zealand**. It includes:  
- **Geographical data** (longitude, latitude, depth)  
- **Seismic activity data** (station count, magnitude uncertainty)  
- **Time features** (year, month, day, hour of occurrence)
